# Vibe Checker Webapp

A Next.js-based web application for testing and evaluating classifiers against real-world policy documents.

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

The app depends on being able to fetch data from an s3 bucket, hosted in the `labs` account and managed by the code in the [infra](../infra) directory. You'll need to authenticate with AWS to access the bucket.

```bash
aws sso login --profile labs
```

## Deployment

The webapp is deployed to AWS ECS Fargate. The deployment is managed by Pulumi IaC in the [infra](../infra) directory.

Assuming the infrastructure is already deployed, there are three major steps in the deployment of the webapp: building the Docker image, pushing it to ECR, and refreshing the ECS task with the new image. You can run each of these steps individually by running the following commands:

```bash
just build-webapp 
just push-webapp
just refresh-webapp-task
```

Alternatively, you can run all three commands in one go by running:

```bash
just deploy-webapp
```

When the deployment is complete, you can monitor the deployment logs by running:

```bash
cd infra
aws logs tail /ecs/vibe-checker --follow --profile labs --region eu-west-1
```

If the app is running happily, you should see logs like this:
